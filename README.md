Developed a 3D U-Net model using CNNs to accurately segment brain tumors from the Brats2020
dataset. The U-Net model achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.844 indicating high accuracy in
brain tumor segmentation and it is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. This model enhances
diagnostic accuracy, aiding radiologists and neurologists. Subsequently, integrated the project into
a full-stack application using Streamlit for both the frontend and backend, with a UI using
HTML and CSS, bridging frontend and backend development for seamless doctor interaction.
